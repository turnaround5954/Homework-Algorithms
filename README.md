# Homework-Algorithms

My solutions to Algorithms I & II on coursera (score: 100/100). <br>
( ╯▽╰) The project structure is a bit messy. <br>
By the time I finished them, I don't know much Java (even now).

---

I uploaded them here to encourage my friends to polish up their programming skills. <br>
Hope this repository can help those in need :D.
